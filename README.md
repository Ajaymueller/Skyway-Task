## The brief

The aim of this assignment was to create a what's on page using json data provided. 

## Tools and technologies Used

Angular
TypeScript 
BootStrap 
Angular Material 
Scss

## The approach 

I decided to use Angular for this project for various reasons. One reason being I use Angular in my current position, so I'm pretty familiar with it. Since I only planned to spend a maximum of 3/4 hours this project, I thought it was best to use a framework that was most fimiliar to me, rather than starting to spend more time learning how another one works. 

To make sure the application is extensionable, scalable and maintainable, I tried to utilise the benefits of Typescript by strongly typing and using models to map the json object to. I also used bootstrap classes and divided various parts of the application into different components so each component was seperated and reponsible for different funcionality. I also used services and pipes to further seperate the code and ensure it is relatively clean. 

## What more could I have done

I could have spent more time on the styling more to make it look a bit nicer, and perhaps added extra functionality so more card data loads on scroll down of the page, rather than all the data arriving at once. I could have also added some extra filters in order to enable filtering by date or location. 


Thank you for viewing my application.
