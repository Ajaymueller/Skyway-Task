## The brief

The aim of this assignment was to create a what's on page using json data provided. 

## Tools and technologies Used

- Angular
- TypeScript 
- BootStrap 
- Angular Material 
- Scss

## The approach 

I decided to use Angular for this project for various reasons. One reason being I use Angular in my current position, so I'm pretty familiar with it. Since I only planned to spend a maximum of 3/4 hours this project, I thought it was best to use a framework that was most fimiliar to me, rather than starting to spend more time learning how another one works. 

To make sure the application is extensionable, scalable and maintainable, I tried to utilise the benefits of Typescript by strongly typing and using models to map the json object to. I also used bootstrap classes and divided various parts of the application into different components so each component was seperated and reponsible for different funcionality, using inputs and outputs to communicate across each component. I also used services and pipes to further seperate the code and ensure it is relatively clean. 

## What more could I have done

I could have spent more time on the styling more to make it look a bit nicer, and perhaps added extra functionality so more card data loads on scroll down of the page, rather than all the data arriving at once. I could have also added some extra filters in order to enable filtering by date or location. 


Thank you for viewing my application.
